## 💰 Phase 3.3: Token Economics

**Purpose**: Complete token mechanics system with staking, rewards, and governance

### Token Specifications

**AI Council Token (ACT)**
- **Symbol**: ACT
- **Chain**: Solana (SPL Token)
- **Decimals**: 9
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 ACT
- **Distribution**: 5 categories (Community 40%, Team 20%, Treasury 20%, Liquidity 10%, Partners 10%)

### Modules Implemented

1. **Token Manager** (`blockchain/token/token_manager.py` - 450 lines)
   - SPL token creation and initialization
   - Minting, burning, and transfers
   - Balance and supply management
   - Allocation distribution

2. **Staking Manager** (`blockchain/token/staking.py` - 400 lines)
   - Time-weighted staking with multipliers
   - Lock periods: 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 days
   - Multipliers: 1.0x, 1.2x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x
   - Voting power calculation
   - Force unstake with 10% penalty

3. **Rewards Distributor** (`blockchain/token/rewards.py` - 380 lines)
   - Proportional reward distribution
   - Three reward boosters: Active (+10%), Long-term (+20%), Governance (+15%)
   - Weekly distribution cycles
   - Auto-compounding option
   - APY calculations

4. **Governance Manager** (`blockchain/token/governance.py` - 120 lines)

   - 5-year economic projections

### Economic Model

**Staking Formula**:
```
voting_power = staked_amount × time_multiplier × (1 + participation_boost)
```

**Reward Formula**:
```
user_reward = total_rewards × (user_voting_power / total_voting_power)
final_reward = base_reward × (1 + sum(active_boosters))
```

**APY Example** (40% staking, 5% inflation):
- Base: 12.5% APY
- With 180-day lock (3.0x): ~37.5% APY
- With max boosters (+45%): ~54% effective APY

**Multi-Year Projection**:
| Year | Circulating | Staked (40%) | Rewards | Inflation | APY |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| 1    | 600M ACT    | 240M         | 30M     | 5.0%      | 12.5% |
| 2    | 660M ACT    | 264M         | 26.4M   | 4.0%      | 10.0% |
| 3    | 713M ACT    | 285M         | 21.4M   | 3.0%      | 7.5%  |
| 4    | 756M ACT    | 302M         | 15.1M   | 2.0%      | 5.0%  |
| 5    | 786M ACT    | 314M         | 15.7M   | 2.0%      | 5.0%  |

## 🎯 Integration with Existing System

### Token-Weighted Voting

```python
# Get user's voting power from staked tokens
voting_power = await staking.calculate_voting_power(wallet)

# Cast weighted vote in council debate
await voting_client.cast_vote(
    debate_id,
    agent_id,
    vote_option,
    voting_power  # Vote weight based on staked tokens
)
```

### Staking Requirements

```python
# Require minimum stake for council participation
MIN_STAKE_FOR_COUNCIL = Decimal(1000)

stake = await staking.get_stake_info(user_wallet)
if stake.amount < MIN_STAKE_FOR_COUNCIL:
    raise ValueError(f"Minimum {MIN_STAKE_FOR_COUNCIL} ACT stake required")
```

### Agent Rewards

```python
# Reward AI agents for debate participation
session_reward_pool = Decimal(1000)

for agent in participating_agents:
    contribution_share = calculate_agent_contribution(agent)
    reward = session_reward_pool * contribution_share

    await token_mgr.transfer(treasury_wallet, agent.wallet, reward)
```
