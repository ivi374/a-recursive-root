## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow **PEP 8** with some additions:

```python
# Use type hints
def create_debate(topic: str, agents: List[Agent]) -> Debate:
    """
    Create a new debate.

    Args:
        topic: The debate topic
        agents: List of participating agents

    Returns:
        Configured Debate instance
    """
    pass

# Use dataclasses for configuration
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Config:
    """Configuration for debate system"""
    topic: str
    rounds: int = 3
    timeout: float = 30.0

# Use async/await for I/O
async def generate_response(prompt: str) -> str:
    """Generate AI response"""
    response = await llm_client.generate(prompt)
    return response
```

**Tools**:
- **Black**: Code formatting (`black .`)
- **pylint**: Linting (`pylint core/ automation/`)
- **mypy**: Type checking (`mypy .`)
