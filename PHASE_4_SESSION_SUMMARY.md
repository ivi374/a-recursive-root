## Integration with Existing System

### How It Fits

**Phase 4.3 integrates with**:
- ✅ Phase 1: Core AI agents and debate system
- ✅ Phase 2: Web backend (ready for API endpoints)
- ✅ Phase 3: Blockchain (can use tokens for voting weight)

**Integration points**:
```python
# 1. During debate setup
await viewer_mgr.open_debate_for_voting(debate_id, topic, description)

# 2. Viewers vote (via WebSocket/API)
await viewer_mgr.submit_viewer_vote(user_id, debate_id, round_number, position)

# 3. After agents vote
hybrid_result = await viewer_mgr.calculate_hybrid_result(
    debate_id, round_number, agent_votes
)

# 4. Use hybrid outcome
final_outcome = hybrid_result.final_outcome

# 5. Finalize and award points
await viewer_mgr.finalize_debate_voting(debate_id, final_outcome)
```
