# Naming Conventions

This document describes naming conventions for files, directories, variables
and identifiers.  Use kebab-case for file and directory names (e.g.
`my-component`), snake_case for environment variables (e.g. `Z_ROOT`), and
UpperCamelCase for class names.  Do not use spaces or special characters.
