## Technical Notes

### Mock Mode Support

All Phase 3 blockchain code supports mock mode, enabled by default:
- `SOLANA_MOCK_MODE=true` (default)
- `CHAINLINK_MOCK_MODE=true` (default)
- `PYTH_MOCK_MODE=true` (default)

This allows development and testing without blockchain connectivity.

### Production Deployment

To deploy to real blockchain:
1. Set mock mode to false
2. Configure RPC endpoints in `.env`
3. Deploy smart contracts to Solana devnet
4. Update program IDs in configuration
5. Test with devnet before mainnet

---

## Dependencies

### Added in Phase 3

**Python**:
- `solana` - Solana Python SDK
- `anchorpy` - Anchor framework bindings
- `construct` - Binary data structures

**Rust** (for smart contracts):
- `anchor-lang` - Anchor framework
- `anchor-spl` - SPL token support

All documented in `requirements.txt` and respective `Cargo.toml` files.

---

## Security Considerations

### Current State

- ✅ Code written with security best practices
- ✅ Type safety throughout
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ⏳ Security audit needed before mainnet
- ⏳ Penetration testing not yet done

### Before Production

1. Professional security audit of smart contracts
2. Economic model review by tokenomics expert
3. Penetration testing
4. Load testing
5. Gradual rollout strategy

---
