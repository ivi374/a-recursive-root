# Maintenance & Housekeeping Playbook

This document aggregates the recurring activities required to keep the platform secure, performant, and orderly.

## Dependency Hygiene

- Schedule weekly checks across `workspace/projects/ai-council-system/` using `scripts/dependency-audit.sh` (to be created).
- Log outcomes in `workspace/_meta/README.md` under the Maintenance ledger.
- Update container images stored in `containers/` when base CVE feeds change.

## Snapshot & Backup Rotation

- Trigger snapshots defined in `cloud/backups.yml`.
- Store artifacts in `workspace/artifacts/` with timestamped directories.
- Document restoration drills in `observability/README.md`.

## Secrets & Configuration

- Rotate environment variables using examples in `environment/examples/`.
- Validate `.env` files against `environment/variables/README.md`.
- Record rotation summaries in `provenance/README.md`.

## Cache Management

- Prune caches under `workspace/caches/` on a rolling two-week basis.
- Maintain language-specific notes in respective cache README files generated by the automation script.

## Compliance Checklist

- Align with `governance/standards/README.md` and `SECURITY.md` monthly.
- Capture exceptions and mitigations in `governance/policies/README.md`.
