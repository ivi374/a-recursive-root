# Reproducibility

To ensure deterministic builds and environments, this document lists
procedures for rebuilding containers, restoring snapshots and verifying
checksums.  Follow the `scripts/hydrate` script to build all development
containers locally.  Use `scripts/verify` to check for missing
dependencies and uncommitted changes.
