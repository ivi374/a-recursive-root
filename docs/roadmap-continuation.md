# Continuation & Expansion Roadmap

## Phase 3.2 – Smart Contracts (Weeks 1-4)

- Solana contract suite build-out in `workspace/projects/ai-council-system/blockchain/contracts/solana/`
  - Voting primitives (`voting/src/`), council selection, staking module.
- Integrate RNG coordinator with on-chain verifiers.
- Establish contract deployment pipeline (GitHub Actions + Anchor CLI) documented in `cloud/README.md`.

## Phase 3.3 – Governance Mechanics (Weeks 5-8)

- Implement governance scoring in `core/council/` with scenario-based simulations.
- Launch participation incentives (token mechanics) stored under `blockchain/token/`.
- Align policies with `governance/standards/` and capture risk mitigations in `provenance/`.

## Phase 4 – Productionization (Weeks 9-16)

- Harden streaming stack in `web/` and `streaming/` directories, add observability instrumentation.
- Introduce user feedback loops recorded in `docs/user/README.md`.
- Conduct security audits referencing `SECURITY.md` and `licenses/README.md`.

## Phase 5 – Ecosystem Scaling (Weeks 17-24)

- Launch partner integrations tracked in `integrations/`.
- Expand AI swarm roles using `ai/agents/roles/` definitions.
- Establish federated governance across `workspace/orgs/` with quarterly reviews.

## Continuous Initiatives

- **Quality Gates**: Enforce tests via `workspace/projects/ai-council-system/tests/`.
- **Knowledge Capture**: Maintain session summaries in `workspace/_meta/README.md`.
- **Community Engagement**: Publish updates through `workspace/projects/ai-council-system/blog/`.
