# Layering

This document describes the logical layers of the cartridge: `archive`
for immutable snapshots, `workspace` for active development, `containers` for
development environments, `cloud` for docking metadata, and `docs` for
documentation.  Each layer serves a specific purpose and can be updated
independently.
