# Agentic Orchestration Blueprint

## Mission

Implement a swarm workflow across @Gemini, @Copilot, @Codex, and OS-aligned automation agents to drive backlog execution, cross-
discipline critique, and quality assurance.

## Agent Roster & Responsibilities

| Agent | Role Focus | Key Deliverables | Feedback Loops |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| @Gemini | Research synthesis & foresight | Annotated bibliographies, strategic briefs | Weekly sync with @Codex for feasibility checks |
| @Copilot | Implementation lead | Code merges, integration tests, developer tooling | Submits PRs reviewed by @Codex |
| @Codex | Architecture & governance | Technical design review, compliance gating, release notes | Bi-directional review with @Gemini & OS agents |
| OS-Agents | Infrastructure + automation | CI pipelines, container governance, deployment automation | Report status into `observability/README.md` |

## Operating Cadence

1. **Intake**: New initiatives logged in `workspace/_meta/README.md` and triaged by @Codex.
2. **Planning**: Task stubs recorded in `workspace/projects/*/README.md` with owner + ETA.
3. **Execution**: @Copilot implements, referencing directory READMEs and docs in `docs/`.
4. **Critique**: @Gemini produces retrospectives documented under `research/README.md`.
5. **Merge & Release**: @Codex signs off, OS-Agents manage automation in `cloud/` and `observability/`.

## Coordination Rituals

- **Daily Standup**: 15-minute async log appended to `workspace/_meta/README.md`.
- **Design Reviews**: Hosted in `docs/architecture/README.md` with links to diagrams.
- **Post-Merge Verification**: Results logged in `observability/README.md` with references to dashboards.

## Tooling Stack Alignment

- Issue tracking: Documented via PR templates in `templates/README.md`.
- Knowledge capture: `docs/interconnected-key.md` ensures discoverability.
- Automation: `tools/generate_directory_readmes.py` keeps structure transparent.
