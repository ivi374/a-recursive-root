# Z Cartridge

This cartridge defines a complete and reproducible environment for your projects.  It
includes a manifest that maps local directories to their upstream counterparts,
governance policies, environment definitions, cloud docking metadata and
documentation.  The contents of this tree are intentionally selfâ€‘describing so
that it can be plugged into any host and rehydrated into a development
environment without guesswork.

## AI Command-Line Interfaces

This repository includes scripts and documentation to help you install and configure common AI command-line interfaces.

### Supported AI CLIs

- **OpenAI CLI** - Python client for OpenAI's APIs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, DALL-E, etc.)
- **Anthropic Claude** - Python client for Claude AI models
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** - Command-line interface for GitHub Copilot

### Installation

Run the installation script to set up all AI CLIs:

```bash
./scripts/install_ai_clis.sh
```

This script will:
1. Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt` (OpenAI and Anthropic clients)
2. Install GitHub Copilot CLI via npm (if Node.js is available)
3. Check for GitHub CLI and provide setup instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** with pip (for OpenAI and Anthropic clients)
- **Node.js and npm** (for GitHub Copilot CLI)
- **GitHub CLI** (optional, for enhanced Copilot integration)

### Configuration

After installation, configure your API keys:

```bash
# OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'

# Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key'
```

For GitHub Copilot, authenticate with:

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Usage Examples

**OpenAI (Python):**
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

**Anthropic Claude (Python):**
```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI:**
```bash
# Get shell command suggestions
github-copilot-cli what-the-shell "list all files modified in the last week"

# Get git command suggestions
github-copilot-cli git-assist "undo last commit but keep changes"
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install components individually:

**Python packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```
