# AI Council System - Development Repository

## 🎯 Project Vision

A decentralized 24/7 live streaming platform where AI agents form organizational bodies to debate real-time events, with user participation through cryptocurrency mechanisms.

## 📋 Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation Architecture

### Project Status

- **Phase**: Foundation & Planning
- **Developer**: Solo (Swarm-Assisted)
- **Start Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Repository**: Development Prototype

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The AI Council System is designed as a modular, scalable "operating system" for decentralized AI collaboration. The core components are organized as follows:

```
ai-council-system/
├── swarm/                  # Swarm orchestration system
│   ├── orchestrator/       # Core orchestration logic
│   ├── roles/              # Role definitions and management
│   └── assemblies/         # Assembly definitions
├── ...                     # Other top-level directories for different system functions
```

For a detailed breakdown of the entire repository structure, please refer to the documentation in the `/docs` directory.

### Swarm Orchestration System

The `swarm` directory contains the core logic for the AI agent orchestration system. This system is responsible for coordinating multiple AI agents to perform complex tasks. It is built on three key concepts:

*   **Roles**: Define the responsibilities and capabilities of agents.
*   **Assemblies**: Define the workflows and success criteria for tasks.
*   **Orchestrator**: Manages the execution of assemblies, including agent assignment and result aggregation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   pip
*   virtualenv (recommended)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-council-system.git
    cd ai-council-system
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

The primary entry point for interacting with the swarm orchestration system is the `SwarmCoordinator` class, located in `swarm/orchestrator/coordinator.py`.

**Basic Example:**

```python
from swarm.orchestrator.coordinator import SwarmCoordinator, Agent
from swarm.assemblies.assembly_loader import get_assembly

# Initialize the coordinator
coordinator = SwarmCoordinator()

# Register an agent
agent = Agent(
    agent_id="007",
    name="James Bond",
    capabilities=["espionage", "seduction", "mixology"]
)
coordinator.register_agent(agent)

# Load an assembly
assembly = get_assembly("example_mission")

# Execute the assembly
if assembly:
    result = coordinator.execute_assembly(assembly, {"mission_briefing": "Infiltrate the secret lair."})
    print(result)
```

## 🚀 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

- [x] Project setup
- [x] README update
- [ ] Core architecture definition
- [ ] Swarm orchestrator implementation
- [ ] Basic AI agent framework
- [ ] Event ingestion prototype

### Phase 2: Prototyping

- [ ] Website launch
- [ ] Twitter presence
- [ ] Token creation (pump.fun)
- [ ] Basic live stream setup

### Phase 3: Core Implementation

- [ ] AI council debates
- [ ] Blockchain RNG integration
- [ ] User interaction mechanics
- [ ] Cryptocurrency rewards

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] Generative visuals
- [ ] Advanced betting mechanics
- [ ] Governance implementation
- [ ] Multi-chain support

### Phase 5: Launch & Scale

- [ ] Public beta
- [ ] Community building
- [ ] 24/7 operations
- [ ] Platform expansion

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Immediate Concerns

1. **Gambling Regulations**: Betting mechanics require compliance with UIGEA, state laws
2. **Securities Law**: Token may be classified as security (Howey Test)
3. **Content Liability**: NSFW content creates platform risks
4. **International Compliance**: EU AI Act, GDPR, etc.

### Mitigation Strategy

- Start with entertainment-focused MVP (no gambling)
- Implement robust content moderation
- Consult legal counsel before token launch
- Build compliance frameworks from day one
