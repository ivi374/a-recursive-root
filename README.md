# Z Cartridge

This cartridge defines a complete and reproducible environment for your projects.  It
includes a manifest that maps local directories to their upstream counterparts,
governance policies, environment definitions, cloud docking metadata and
documentation.  The contents of this tree are intentionally selfâ€‘describing so
that it can be plugged into any host and rehydrated into a development
environment without guesswork.
