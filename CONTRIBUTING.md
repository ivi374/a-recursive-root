## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. **Branch naming conventions:**
   - Feature: `feature/description` or `username/feature-description`
   - Bug fix: `fix/description` or `username/fix-description`
   - Documentation: `docs/description` or `username/docs-description`
   - AI-generated: `copilot/description` or `claude/description`

2. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-username/feature-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes:**
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Test your changes locally

4. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-username/feature-description
   ```

### Working with AI Assistants

This repository welcomes contributions from AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.). When working with AI:

1. **Branch naming:** Use prefixes like `copilot/` or `claude/` for AI-generated branches
2. **PR description:** Clearly indicate AI assistance in the PR description
3. **Review carefully:** Always review AI-generated code before committing
4. **Test thoroughly:** Ensure AI-generated code passes all tests

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure your code follows the project's code style
   - Run all tests and ensure they pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add or update tests for new features

2. **PR Description:**
   - Provide a clear title summarizing the change
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Note any breaking changes

3. **Review Process:**
   - At least one maintainer review is required
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep the PR focused (avoid scope creep)
   - Rebase if requested to maintain a clean history

4. **After Approval:**
   - Maintainers will merge your PR
   - Your branch will be deleted automatically

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation files
- Keep line length to ~80-100 characters for readability
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include code examples where helpful

### Commit Messages

Follow the conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(swarm): add task decomposition strategy

Implemented hierarchical task decomposition for complex workflows.
This allows better parallelization of agent tasks.

Fixes #42
```
